            <p class="section-subtitle">Consulting for Community was born from a desire to help locals fight for their communities in a system that is biased towards big business and developers. After spending my early career working in Local Government, I saw the need to give locals a voice. Too often, real concerns were disregarded because they didn't use the "correct" language of planning and were seen as emotional rather than rational. In order to give locals the best chance to be heard, I founded Consulting for Community and have been providing professional guidance ever since.</p>
