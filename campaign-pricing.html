                    Costs are split among locals using a ticketing
                    system, so everyone contributes and benefits together.
                    Our milestone-based pricing ensures transparency and fairness for

                <h3>Milestones & Deliverable Examples</h3>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem">
                    <li>
                        <strong>$500</strong> &mdash; Research and drafting of a submission
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>$1,000</strong> &mdash; Research and representation at Council
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>$2,000</strong> &mdash; Ongoing comprehensive community representation
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How Ticketing Works</h3>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem">
                    <li>
                        Each campaign sets a ticket price (e.g., <strong>$50</strong> per ticket).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Every ticket purchased goes towards reaching the next milestone.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once enough tickets are sold to reach a milestone, consultants begin work on that deliverable.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Example</h3>
                <p> 
                    If 25 tickets are purchased at $50 each, the total raised is <strong>$1,250</strong>. This covers the first two milestones ($500 + $1,000 = $1,500), but since only $1,250 was raised, the second milestone is partially funded. If more tickets are sold and the total exceeds the milestone cost, any excess is refunded equally among all ticket holders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, if $1,250 is raised and the last milestone was $1,000, the extra $250 is refunded: <br /><strong>$250 / 25 tickets = $10 refund per ticket holder</strong>.
                </p>
                <h3>Refunds & Fairness</h3>
                <ul style="margin-left: 1.5rem">
                <li>
                    Any funds raised above the milestone cost are refunded equally to
                    all ticket holders.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This ensures everyone pays only their fair share for each
                    deliverable.
                </li>
                </ul>
